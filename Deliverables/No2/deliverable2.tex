\noindent\textbf{Terms}

The term ``task'' is often used in the team charter. 
It substitutes all RTC element types â€“ e.g. business deliverable, defect etc. unless otherwise stated.

\pagebreak
Multiple reasons exist for preparing a team charter. One is to document the team's purpose and clearly define individual roles, responsibilities, and operating rules. Next, it establishes procedures for both the team and agency management on communicating, reporting, and decision-making procedures. It lays out a blueprint for conducting business for the acquisition and defines how the team works in an empowered manner, including setting out responsibility and authority. Finally it facilitates stakeholder buy in by including key members in the decision making process and obtaining their concurrence along the way. 

\section{Purpose/Vision} % (fold)
\label{sec:purpose_vision}

The aim of this project is to provide an API, with which the Danske Bank (DB) Android App could be extended. The proposed extension will facilitate easy transfer of money from one DB customer's account to another DB customer's account, by merely bumping their phones together.

This extension of the app aligns with the company's marketing strategy, by adding another ``cool'' technology to the app, which users will hopefully show off to friends and family similar to the recent/current voice recognition ``craze'' (Voice Search, Voice and Translate from Google, Tellme voice search for Windows Phone 7 etc.).

In addition to the social advertising aspects it further solidifies Danske Banks presence in the mobile area, which is one the factors currently differentiating DB from it's competitors for Danish private customers. 

Finally it's worth noting that PayPal, which is a major international player in micro-payments, currently has Bump functionality in their mobile app. While PayPal does not pose a significant threat to DB at present time it's worth staying on the forefront in case of a sudden surge in either micro-payments or Bump-technology ``craze''.

\subsection{Configuration management} % (fold)
\label{subsec:configuration_management}

We use Git as our SCM system. 
Our repository is hosted publicly on GitHub.

We're using a Test Driven Development approach, which imposes the following structure on the \texttt{master} branch:
\begin{itemize}
\item Code committed to the central repository must be thoroughly covered by JUnit tests.
\item Tests must not fail when comitted, even if this means methods are stubbed.
\item Code must compile.
\end{itemize}

% subsection configuration_management (end)

\subsection{Office rules} % (fold)
\label{subsec:office_rules}
When working together, e.g. sitting together and working on stories, the following should be respected:

\begin{itemize}
	\item No loud music or noises

	\item Procrastination should not affect others
\end{itemize}
% subsection office_rules (end)

\subsection{Calendar planning} % (fold)
\label{subsec:calendar_planning}

We have agreed to do a daily virtual scrum logging, where each participant writes an entry firstly about what he did today, what he will do tomorrow, and if any problems have occurred.

Sprint demos will occur at, or around, the ending of a sprint, depending on when the product owner have got time.
At the time of sprint demo, we will properly want to do a sprint planning, for the following sprint, together with the product owner.

At the end of a sprint, we will have a so-called sprint retrospective, discussing what went well and what could be approved for next sprint.

\section{Team performance \& progress monitoring} % (fold)
\label{sec:team_performance_progress_monitoring}
We will use Google Docs as our scrum tool, but we're planning to (briefly) evaluate some of the scrum tools mentioned at lectures, and also IBM's JAZZ.

The purpose of a scrum tool is to be able to have a virtual storyboard and burndown.
