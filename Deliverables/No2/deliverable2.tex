\section{Purpose/Vision} % (fold)
\label{sec:purpose_vision}

The aim of this project is to provide a library, which Android App developers can utilize to facilitate secure communication through Bump.

Information exchanged through Bump is subject to the Bump privacy policy, which specifically states that Bump is allowed to retain all exchanged information. For co-op games and other non-sensitive applications this may be good enough, but for exhange of financial information it is not neccesarily good enough.

We have chosen to focus our sample application and prototype to target financial institututions and bank where high security and transactional confidentiality is a prerequisite, but the library will be of value to anyone who wants to utilize the Bump API while safeguarding transactions.

Banks who use our library will be able to facilitate easy transfer of money from one customer's account to another customer's account, by merely bumping their phones together.

Danske Bank is one potential customer, since its marketing strategy is throughly based on a strong presence in both social media and on the mobile platform. Their mobile banking application already has a number of technology features and it is one of the key differentiating features compared to their competitors among Danish banks.

In addition to easing transactions, adding Bump would add yet another ``cool'' feature, which users will hopefully show off to friends and family similar to the recent/current voice recognition ``craze'' (Voice Search, Voice and Translate from Google, Tellme voice search for Windows Phone 7 etc.), thus adding further value through viral marketing.

Finally it's worth noting that PayPal, which is a major international player in micro-payments, currently has Bump functionality in their mobile app. While PayPal does not pose a significant threat to established financial institutions at present time it's worth staying on the forefront in case of a sudden surge in either micro-payments or Bump-technology ``craze''.

\subsection{Roadmap} % (fold)
\label{subsec:roadmap}
Our roadmap is divided into our five sprints.

These five sprints, and their goals, are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sprint \#1 (March 11$^{\text{th}}$, 2011)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Read up on relevant documentation, APIs and product and process brief refined. Implementation of a fully working prototype that allows two Android smartphones to be bumped together and transfer information between them.
	\end{itemize}
\pagebreak
	\item Sprint \#2 (April 1$^{\text{st}}$, 2011)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Sample App that can perform secure transfers between two phones. Functionality packaged as a distributable library.

		\item Different approaches as how to secure information in transit have been evaluated and benefits and drawbacks have been thoroughly examined. Prototype app can perform secure communication using the preferred approach.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Sprint \#4 (May 20$^{\text{th}}$, 2011)
	\begin{itemize}

\section{User/Customer} % (fold)
\label{sec:user_customer}

Our customers are Android app developers, banks and financial institutions in particular, who are interested in utilizing the Bump to facilitate communication or transactions between two phones, but are not interested in leaving entirely in the hands of the creators of Bump and having clear text data be subject to the Bump privacy policy.

Sune Lomholt has agreed to act as a representative of our product owner(s).

\subsection{Configuration management} % (fold)
\label{subsec:configuration_management}

We use Git as our SCM system. 
Our repository is hosted publicly on GitHub.

We're using a Test Driven Development approach, which imposes the following structure on the \texttt{master} branch:
\begin{itemize}
\item Code committed to the central repository must be thoroughly covered by JUnit tests.
\item Tests must not fail when comitted, even if this means methods are stubbed.
\item Code must compile.
\end{itemize}

% subsection configuration_management (end)

\subsection{Office rules} % (fold)
\label{subsec:office_rules}
When working together, e.g. sitting together and working on stories, the following should be respected:

\begin{itemize}
	\item No loud music or noises

	\item Procrastination should not affect others
\end{itemize}
% subsection office_rules (end)

\subsection{Calendar planning} % (fold)
\label{subsec:calendar_planning}

We have agreed to do a daily virtual scrum logging, where each participant writes an entry firstly about what he did today, what he will do tomorrow, and if any problems have occurred.

Sprint demos will occur at, or around, the ending of a sprint, depending on when the product owner have got time.
At the time of sprint demo, we will properly want to do a sprint planning, for the following sprint, together with the product owner.

At the end of a sprint, we will have a so-called sprint retrospective, discussing what went well and what could be approved for next sprint.

\section{Team performance \& progress monitoring} % (fold)
\label{sec:team_performance_progress_monitoring}
To support our process we are interested in a scrum tool that, especially because we have no offices or static whiteboards, facilitates a virtual collaboration using the scrum model.

We are using Google Docs as our scrum tool and have set up a logbook of (virtual) daily scrum meetings, burndown chart, sprint- and product backlogs.

Throughout Sprint 1 we will will assess how the tools are working to ensure that they are being used to their maximum potential and they are providing the neccesary product support.

Pending this assessment we will consider evaluating additional scrum tools, such as IBM's Rational Team Concert (based on the Jazz collaboration platform).
