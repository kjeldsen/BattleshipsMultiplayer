\section{Requirements for this deliverable}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Doing a demo in class (on 2011-05-18)
\item Giving us access to your source code
\item Handing in a collection of your sprint material
\item Describing a sprint retrospective (e.g., as a set of bullets outlining what
when well, what went wrong, and how you will improve for the next sprint)
\end{enumerate}

The Sprint Demo was given on May 18th. This document describes requirements 2-4 as well as the sprint learning goal -- mutual code inspection in our group and group Bravo.

\section{Sprint material}
Sprint Material needed to assess our progress include the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item source code (version number and access method is sufficient)
\item product backlog (before and after the sprint)
\item sprint backlog
\item any other material (e.g., burndown chart) that illustrates your progress
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Source Code}

%The final product of sprint \#4 has been tagged \href{https://github.com/omegahm/DBP2P/tree/sprintdemo2}{\tt sprintdemo3}. in the git repository, where the application is located in the folder {\tt DustyTubaSampleApp}.

%The following main tasks have been completed during this sprint:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item ``Libraryfying'' our code
%	\item Using the library to establish Bluetooth connection (2.1+ devices only)
%	\item Wrote documentation
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item Both for future developers of the library, as well as for users of the library
%	\end{enumerate}
%\end{itemize}

%In regards to our user stories, the tasks completed correspond to the following user stories:
%\begin{verbatim}
%  As a        customer of the API
%  I want to   be able to decide the data structure of the information
%  Such that   I can structure the messages according to my needs
%\end{verbatim}
