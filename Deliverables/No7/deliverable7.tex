\section{Requirements for this deliverable}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Doing a demo in class (on 2011-05-18)
\item Giving us access to your source code
\item Handing in a collection of your sprint material
\item Describing a sprint retrospective (e.g., as a set of bullets outlining what
when well, what went wrong, and how you will improve for the next sprint)
\item Description of process improvement efforts
\end{enumerate}

The Sprint Demo was given on June 8th. This document describes requirements 2-4 as well as the sprint learning goal -- reflection on and improvement of our software development process.

\section{Sprint material}
Sprint Material needed to assess our progress include the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item source code (version number and access method is sufficient)
\item product backlog (before and after the sprint)
\item sprint backlog
\item any other material (e.g., burndown chart) that illustrates your progress
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sprint Backlog}
Our sprint backlog is shown in figure \ref{sprintbacklog} on page \pageref{sprintbacklog}.

\subsection{Burndown chart}

Our burndown chart is shown in figure \ref{burndown} on page \pageref{burndown}.

\section{Sprint retrospective}

What went well during this sprint:

\begin{itemize}
\item Early start of development
\item Good idea for sample application
\item Motivated development
\end{itemize}

\noindent
What went wrong:
\begin{itemize}
\item Nothing
\end{itemize}

\noindent
How we will improve:
\begin{itemize}
\item Weâ€™ll do further reflection during the exam, when course has been fully concluded
\end{itemize}

\section{Process improvement}

Discussing our past retrospectives yielded some useful info which used to generate the FRIM chart seen in figure \ref{frim} on page \pageref{frim}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|p{3cm}|p{3cm}|p{3cm}|p{3cm}|}
	\hline
		& Once & Several times & Often & All the time \\\hline
	+2  & & & Skype meetings \par\vspace{.3cm} Demos & Acunote tool for Scrum \\\hline
	+1  & & Product owner meetings & Coherent breakdown of tasks with time estimates \par\vspace{.3cm} Lectures & Use of shared calendar \par\vspace{.3cm} Git as configuration management tool \\\hline
	 0  & Code inspection with other team & & Virtual scrum meetings & \\\hline
	-1  & & Communication hickups & User stories & \\\hline
	-2  & Easter holiday & Forced re-definement of project scope \par\vspace{.3cm} Underestimation of task workload & Majority of work was postponed to end of sprint & \\\hline
	\end{tabular}	
	\caption{FRIM}
	\label{frim}
\end{figure}

We then generated the AB Matrix seen in figure \ref{abmatrix} on page \pageref{abmatrix}, however with only 3 team members we did not split up into two teams (A and B) which is why our matrix is really just a vector.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{3cm}|p{3cm}|p{3cm}|}
	\hline
	What is working? \par What is right? & What is good behaviour? & What is not quite working yet? & What does the ideal situation look like? \tabularnewline\hline

	Acunote tool for tracking Scrum process
	\par\vspace{.5cm}

	\par\vspace{.5cm}
	Good sharing of knowledge

	\par\vspace{.5cm}
	Clearly defined goal(s) from the beginning
	\tabularnewline\hline
	\end{tabular}	
	\caption{AB Matrix}
	\label{abmatrix}
\end{figure}

Finally we decided how to address this in this sprint; the results of which can be seen in figure \ref{whattodo} on page \pageref{whattodo}.

  \begin{figure}[ht!]
  	\begin{center}
  	% Insert burndown chart here
  	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{whattodo.png}		
  	\end{center}
  	\caption{What to do}

  \end{figure}
