\section{Requirements for this deliverable}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Doing a demo in class (on 2011-03-30)
\item Giving us access to your source code
\item Handing in a collection of your sprint material
\item Describing a sprint retrospective (e.g., as a set of bullets outlining what
when well, what went wrong, and how you will improve for the next sprint)
\end{enumerate}

The Sprint Demo was given on March 9th. This document describes requirements 2-4.

\section{Source code access}
Our source code is publicly available on Github from \url{https://github.com/omegahm/DBP2P}.

Please note that we are working on multiple branches (use the button switch branch to view another branch).

The master branch currently holds only documentation and deliverables, while we have a dedicated development branch for sprint \#1 named \texttt{dustytuba}.

If you wish to checkout our code (read-only) using Git, then use git clone with this URL:
\url{git://github.com/omegahm/DBP2P.git}


\section{Sprint material}
%TODO
Sprint Material needed to assess our progress include the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item source code (version number and access method is sufficient)
\item product backlog (before and after the sprint)
\item sprint backlog
\item any other material (e.g., burndown chart) that illustrates your progress
\end{itemize}

% TODO: Describe Acunote in general and that access have been granted.

\subsection{Source Code}
