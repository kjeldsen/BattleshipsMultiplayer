\noindent\textbf{Terms}

The term ‘task’ is often used in the team charter. 
It substitutes all RTC element types – e.g. business deliverable, defect etc. unless otherwise stated.

\pagebreak
Multiple reasons exist for preparing a team charter. One is to document the team’s purpose and clearly define individual roles, responsibilities, and operating rules. Next, it establishes procedures for both the team and agency management on communicating, reporting, and decision-making procedures. It lays out a blueprint for conducting business for the acquisition and defines how the team works in an empowered manner, including setting out responsibility and authority. Finally it facilitates stakeholder buy in by including key members in the decision making process and obtaining their concurrence along the way. 

\section{Purpose/Vision} % (fold)
\label{sec:purpose_vision}

The aim of this project is to extend the functionality of the Danske Bank (DB) Android App. The proposed extension will facilitate easy transfer of money from one DB customer's account to another DB customer's account, by merely bumping their phones together.

This extension of the app aligns with the company's marketing strategy, by adding another "cool" technology to the app, which users will hopefully show off to friends and family similar to the recent/current voice recognition "craze" (Voice Search, Voice and Translate from Google, Tellme voice search for Windows Phone 7 etc.).

In addition to the social advertising aspects it further solidifies Danske Banks presence in the mobile area, which is one the factors currently differentiating DB from it's competitors for Danish private customers. 

Finally it's worth noting that PayPal, which is a major international player in micro-payments, currently has Bump functionality in their mobile app. While PayPal does not pose a significant threat to DB at present time it's worth staying on the forefront in case of a sudden surge in either micro-payments or Bump-technology "craze".
